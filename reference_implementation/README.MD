## Reference Implementation
These reference implementations are developed specifically for testing and evaluation, and to be run in a controlled manner as part of a larger evaluation framework. Hence, they may not be exemplary implementations when it comes to input validation, generating informative error messages, and so on.

The reference implementations are distributed as JAR archives. You can find them here: ForwardClient.jar and ForwardServer.jar.
